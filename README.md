This is a blockchain project developed for the IT003 course. The project involves creating a simple blockchain application for managing personal assets and transactions.

## Features

- Add personal assets
- Create transactions between users
- Validate and display the blockchain

## Requirements: 
```sh
pip install Flask
pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy
```
## Running the Application
1. Clone the repo and ensure that you are in the project directory.
2. Run the file `build_web.py`
```sh
py .\build_web.py
```
3. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`. Users on the same network can also access the web application by navigating to `http://<your_local_IP>:8080`, where `<your_local_IP>` is the IP address of the machine running the application.
